        is not merely a concept; rather, it is a healthy practice. We believe engineering is an art of adapting nature; and, 
        any effort to conquer it is disastrous. Therefore, to us, water engineering is for serving ecology and mankind, living and non-living (so-called).
         We religiously believe that so long as the hydraulic cycle runs uninterruptedly, this earth would exist." />
